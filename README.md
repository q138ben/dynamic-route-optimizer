# dynamic-route-optimizer
The goal is to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles visiting a set of locations.




## Key Aspects of the Challenge

**Dynamic Order Arrival**:
The team must manage new orders as they come in, integrating them into existing routes without causing significant delays. This requires continuous re-optimization of routes, which can be computationally intensive.

**Real-Time Data Integration**:
Incorporating live data—such as traffic conditions, accidents, and weather changes—is critical. The optimization algorithms need to quickly adjust routes in response to these variables to ensure timely deliveries.

**Computational Complexity**:
Route optimization, particularly the vehicle routing problem (VRP), is known to be NP-hard. Finding near-optimal solutions in a fraction of a second, while balancing multiple constraints (like delivery time windows, vehicle capacities, and driver availability), is a significant challenge.

**Scalability**:
As the volume of orders increases, the system must scale efficiently. Ensuring that the optimization engine can handle a growing number of deliveries without a drop in performance is essential for maintaining high service levels.

**Trade-offs Between Optimality and Speed**:
The system must balance the need for the most efficient route with the practical requirement to deliver solutions quickly. Sometimes a slightly suboptimal route may be acceptable if it can be computed much faster.
